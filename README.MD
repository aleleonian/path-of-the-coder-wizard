# Path of the Coder Wizard - Week 1

Starting my journey today.
My goal this week is to sharpen my Modern JavaScript skills:
- Master async/await
- Practice nullish coalescing `??`
- Use optional chaining `?.`
- Refactor messy code into clean, modern code

This is not a hobby. This is my evolution. üõ°Ô∏è
