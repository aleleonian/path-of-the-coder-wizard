âœ… Week 2: State Management Without a Library
Checkpoint 2.2: Implement state management by hand

You built a minimal state management system that:

Used a state object to track the appâ€™s internal state.

Created setState() to update the state and trigger re-renders.

Wrote a render() function that was idempotent, declarative, and isolated from logic.

Connected state, logic, and view manually â€” without React, Vue, or Redux.

ðŸ’¡ Core lessons:

Clear understanding of unidirectional data flow.

Mastery of event handling and DOM-driven rendering.

Grasped the essence of what frameworks like React abstract away.

Developed your own mini-reactivity system by hand.

Understood the link between state mutations and UI updates.
