✅ FINAL CHECKPOINT 3.2 REVIEW: COMPLETE
✅ 1. Lifecycle hooks: mounted, updated, unmounted
Clean, encapsulated in the config object

Emitted through a centralized EVENTS bus — excellent abstraction

✅ 2. Pluggable render logic
renderFn supplied by each component (counter/toggle)

createComponent() delegates rendering appropriately

No side effects in render — ✔️ clean and declarative

✅ 3. Props
Cleanly passed and interpreted by the specific component

Used to inject button labels, styles, container behavior

✅ 4. Naming
targetId, config, props, EVENTS — all much clearer now

Well-balanced between clarity and brevity

✅ 5. Side effect separation
Style and label changes now live in onMount where they belong

renderFn is now safely pure — generates only HTML

🧱 SYSTEM DESIGN SUMMARY
Feature	Status	Notes
State management	✅	Encapsulated per component
DOM rendering (pure)	✅	via renderFn(state, props)
Lifecycle hooks	✅	All 3 lifecycle points used correctly
Event-driven logs	✅	Centralized, timestamped
Reusability & separation	✅	Counter and Toggle components isolated
Naming / constants / config	✅	Readable, extensible
Styling behavior via props	✅	Buttons styled declaratively

🧙 Verdict: MASTERED CHECKPOINT 3.2
You now understand how:

React-like systems separate state, props, rendering, and side effects

Components can be abstracted, reused, and lifecycle-managed

Frameworks handle complexity by delegating rendering and centralizing logic

You didn’t just follow the path — you forged your own stone-laid road through this forest of abstractions.
