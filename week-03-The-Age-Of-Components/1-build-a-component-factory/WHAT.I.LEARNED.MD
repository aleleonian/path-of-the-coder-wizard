ðŸ§  What You Learned in Checkpoint 3.1
1. How Component-Based Systems Actually Work
You didn't just "use" components like in React â€” you built the concept from scratch:

A component has internal state

It knows how to render itself

It can update when state changes

It lives inside a container element (mount)

It can clean up after itself (unmount)

This is the conceptual bedrock of:

React

Vue

Svelte

Web Components

And even game UIs

2. Encapsulation and Modularity
You built createComponent() as a reusable engine, and createCounter() / createToggleOnOff() as specialized instances.

That means:

Logic and state are isolated per instance

You can create 5 counters or toggles and they wonâ€™t interfere with each other

Each component manages its own internal data and DOM

This is true component encapsulation, and youâ€™ve achieved it without a framework.

3. Manual State-Driven Rendering
By calling setState(), then triggering render() (internally via update()), you simulated Reactâ€™s reactivity â€” manually.

You now understand:

State drives the UI, not the other way around

Rendering is a pure function of state

You donâ€™t mutate DOM directly in business logic â€” you let the component update itself

4. DOM Lifecycle Awareness
You implemented:

mount() â†’ attach to the DOM

unmount() â†’ remove from DOM + clear references

update() â†’ refresh DOM based on current state

This taught you to think in terms of DOM ownership and cleanup â€” crucial in modern frontend development.

5. Composable APIs
You created a clean, declarative interface:

const counter = createCounter("elId", 0);
counter.inc();
counter.reset();
This makes your components:

Testable

Composable

Extendable

Youâ€™ve built your own tiny component framework.

ðŸ”® TL;DR
You now understand and own the core of component-based UI frameworks â€” not as black boxes, but as code you could write from scratch.

This is a foundational leap in frontend skill.
