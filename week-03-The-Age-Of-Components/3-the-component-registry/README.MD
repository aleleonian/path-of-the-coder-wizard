🧱 Checkpoint 3.3 — The Component Registry
🎯 Mission: Build a central registry to track all mounted components so they can be queried, managed, or unmounted globally.

🧠 Why It Matters
You're now building infrastructure that resembles:

React’s Virtual DOM diff tree

Vue’s component registry

Angular’s component injector map

This enables:

Global debugging (getAllComponents())

Bulk operations (unmountAll())

Inter-component communication (sendMessageTo('counter-1'))

✅ Features to Implement
1. Create a ComponentRegistry
A central object with methods like:


ComponentRegistry.register(id, component)
ComponentRegistry.get(id)
ComponentRegistry.getAll()
ComponentRegistry.unregister(id)
This lets you track:

The unique ID of each mounted component

Their type (optional)

Their state (read-only access)

2. Integrate It Into createComponent()
When a component is mounted:

Register it with the registry

On unmount, unregister it

⚠️ You may need to extend your component API to include id, type, or metadata.

3. Expose Dev Utilities (optional)
In your main() or window.myApp, add:
 
window.myApp.registry = ComponentRegistry
Now you can do:


myApp.registry.getAll()
myApp.registry.get('Component-12345')
📎 Bonus Objectives
Add a type property to components ("counter", "toggle", etc.)

Add filtering (getByType('counter'))

Allow sending messages/events to components via the registry

🧪 Example Use Case

const allCounters = ComponentRegistry.getByType('counter');
allCounters.forEach(counter => counter.setState(0));
🛡️ Why This Is Wizardry-Level
You’re now building the kind of architecture used in:

Game engines

UI renderers

Simulation platforms

Modular plugin systems

You’re not just using components — you're now managing them as a system.
