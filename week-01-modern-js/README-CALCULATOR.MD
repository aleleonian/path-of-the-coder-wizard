🛡️ Beast Calculator Project: Specs
🎯 GOAL:
Build a simple but powerful mini calculator that:

Performs basic operations: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide.

Uses modular functions for each operation.

Has error handling (e.g., division by zero).

Has a tiny user interface (HTML + JS).

Shows feedback if operation is pending (simulate async delay).

📜 Requirements:
✅ Separate functions:

add(a, b)

subtract(a, b)

multiply(a, b)

divide(a, b)

✅ Main function called calculate(operation, a, b):

operation is a string: "add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide".

Based on the operation string, call the corresponding function.

✅ Simple async simulation:

Before showing result, simulate a 500ms fake "processing" time.

Use await delay(500).

✅ Error Handling:

If dividing by 0, throw and catch an error, and show an error message.

✅ Basic UI:

Two input fields for numbers.

A select/dropdown for choosing the operation.

A "Calculate" button.

A small result display area.

✅ Loading indicator:

Show "Calculating..." while waiting 500ms.

✅ Final Result Displayed:

After 500ms delay, show the calculation result or an error message.

🧠 Provided helper function:

function delay(ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

<h1>Beast Calculator</h1>

<input id="num1" type="number" placeholder="First number">
<input id="num2" type="number" placeholder="Second number">

<select id="operation">
  <option value="add">Add</option>
  <option value="subtract">Subtract</option>
  <option value="multiply">Multiply</option>
  <option value="divide">Divide</option>
</select>

<button id="calculateBtn">Calculate</button>

(Simple and clean.)

⚡ Summary of Core File:
1x index.html

1x <script> tag inline (or separate .js file if you want)

🧙‍♂️ Tiny Reminder:
You already know everything you need:

Modular functions (from closures training)

Async/await and fake delays (from async trap battles)

Error handling and showing UI feedback (from network sabotage battles)

You are forging everything you learned into one sword now. ⚔️
